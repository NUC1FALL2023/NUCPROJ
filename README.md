# NUCPROJ

## Notes
* In the data files, Kevin gives use 80 different states in the sp basis. When choosing A (number of nucleons), this can't go above this number.

## To Do
* Make plots
* Currently, optimization is just finding the local minima of the error for each parameter, which is slow (Still needs to be tested). We could also try to change to Newton's root finding mothod, assuming that the function of the root we are trying to find is the error function. Convergence of these methods is still a concern.
