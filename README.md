# NUCPROJ

## Notes
* In the data files, Kevin gives use 80 different states in the sp basis. When choosing A (number of nucleons), this can't go above this number.

## To Do
* Double check whether the method is correct, everyone should do this.
* Output needs to be written in the sp-orbital notation.
* Optimization, this thing is **SLOW**
* Choose an hw quanta, currently set to 1 MeV, might look better at 10 MeV?
* Max number of iterations, currently set to 10 just to test the method.
* How to choose the energy difference, sum of squares? Current just summing them. Also need to choose how small of a difference we'd want to find.
* For number 2 and 3, we probably should code a generator in a separate py file, then we can load it in the same code we have for 1.
